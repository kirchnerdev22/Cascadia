            Cascadia's Basecamp location is not just a coffee shop; it's where the magic happens. Established in 2018, this cozy coffee shop and roastery are situated in the heart of the picturesque mountain town of Evergreen, Washington.

            Our on-site roastery, pictured below, is where our talented roasters carefully roast our coffee beans to perfection. The aroma of freshly roasted coffee fills the air, creating an enticing and aromatic experience for our visitors.
